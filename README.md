# Date Me

## Minimal?

Yes! This project is just me trying to create a website using Nim, all design is done by basic HTML and Bootstrap, everything else is coded in Nim! The idea is so I don't have to do any frontend, and focus on the fun part of the project :)

## Why a dating website?

I rolled a dice, with each number having a project linked to it, and it rolled a 3 (Date Website)!

## Setup

Install requirements (make sure you have nim and nimble installed).


`nimble install prologue allographer`

## Running the program

Run: `nim -r c main.nim`
